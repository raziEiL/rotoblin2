## News 2021
* multilanguage & dev branch were merged and brings tons of changes: fixes, features, optimization.  
* Left 4 Downtown extension is highly outdated and no longer required! 
* Rotoblin 2 & Competitive plugins has been updated to use with SourceMod >= 1.10 and migrated to left4dhooks plugin! 
* Co-op gamemode is now supported!  

## Co-op
If you load config changed mp_gamemode to `coop` map will be changed from `l4d_vs_` to `l4d_` (and vise verse) by `rotoblin_restartmap` command executed from `rotoblin_main.cfg`.
### Convars:
```
rotoblin_item_translations // Keep items to translations in co-op gamemode
```
The following convars only support versus gamemode! So they should be disabled in co-op.
```
rotoblin_molotov_before_tank
rotoblin_boss_unprohibit
```
